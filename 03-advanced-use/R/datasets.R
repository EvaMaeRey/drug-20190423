#' PEDALFAST DATA SETS
#'
#' There are two data sets provided in the pedalfast package.
#'
#' \describe{
#'   \item{\code{colo_utah_all}}{All known Colorao and Utah data}
#'   \item{\code{colo_utah}}{Colorado and Utah data for the ICD-10 Era, discharge date on or after Oct 1, 2015}
#' }
#'
#' Some noteable edits and constructed variables:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item The colorado data had two columns to denote male/female. The
#'   values in the original 'female' column has been replaced by the values in
#'   the 'prosfemale' column and likewise original 'hospdispo' has been replaced
#'   by the values in 'hospdispousing'.  In both cases, the latter column has
#'   been removed from the data set.
#'
#'   \item there is a column \code{state} to denote Colorado or Utah in the
#'   data sets.
#'
#'   \item the variable \code{anycraniyn} has been added to both the
#'   Colorado and Utah data sets defined as
#'   \code{as.integer(decomcranyn | subhemyn | epihemyn)}.
#'
#'   \item The variable \code{decomcranyn_mod} has been addd to both Colorado
#'   and Utah data and is defined as \code{as.integer(anycraniyn == 1 &
#'   subhemyn == 0 & epihemyn == 0)}.
