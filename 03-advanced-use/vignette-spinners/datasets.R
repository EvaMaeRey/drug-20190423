#' # NCHS - Leading Causes of Death: United States
#'
#' From the data.gov website:
#'
#'> This dataset presents the age-adjusted death rates for the 10 leading causes of death in the United States beginning in 1999. Data are based on information from all resident death certificates filed in the 50 states and the District of Columbia using demographic and medical characteristics. Age-adjusted death rates (per 100,000 population) are based on the 2000 U.S. standard population. Populations used for computing death rates after 2010 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 census, estimated as of July 1, 2010. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for non-census years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published. Causes of death classified by the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICDâ€“10) are ranked according to the number of deaths assigned to rankable causes. Cause of death statistics are based on the underlying cause of death.

#'
#' The `113 Cause Name` and `Cause Name` columns are redundant.  There is a
#' one-to-one mapping between the values in these columns:
with(nchs, table(`Cause Name`, `113 Cause Name`)) %>%
  apply(1, `>`, 0) %>%
  rowSums

#'
#' We will omit the `113 Cause Name` from the saved data set.
nchs %<>% dplyr::select(-`113 Cause Name`)
nchs

#'
#' A quick inspection of the data set suggests there are some changes over time
#' or that the reporting is not as expected.  50 States, 10 causes of death, 
{{ dplyr::n_distinct(nchs$Year) }}
#' years of data would suggest
{{ 50 * 10 * dplyr::n_distinct(nchs$Year) }}
#' rows of data, not the 
{{ qwraps2::frmt(nrow(nchs)) }} 
#' in the set.
#'
#' Let's investigate this issue.  First, the State column is not just the 50
#' States of the United States:
table(nchs$State)

#'
#' All 50 states are listed
all(state.name %in% nchs$State)

#'
#' What are the other values for State?
setdiff(nchs$State, state.name)

#'
#' District of Columbia is not that surprising but the value "United States" is.
nchs %>% dplyr::filter(State == "United States")

#'
#' It seems possible that the rows denoted "United States" could be totals for
#' the country.
dplyr::left_join(
                 {
                   nchs %>%
                     dplyr::filter(State != "United States") %>%
                     dplyr::group_by(Year, `Cause Name`) %>%
                     dplyr::summarize(Deaths = sum(Deaths)) %>%
                     dplyr::ungroup(.)
                 }
                ,
                 { 
                   nchs %>%
                     dplyr::filter(State == "United States") %>%
                     dplyr::select(Year, `Cause Name`, Deaths)
                 }

                suffix = c(".state", ".us")) %>%
print %>%
dplyr::summarize(all(Deaths.state == Deaths.us))

#'
#' After verifying that the `State == "United States"` is the total for the
#' country it seems reasonable to seperate these rows into a seperate data set.
#' Further, the `All causes` option for `Cause Name` suggests yet another data
#' set sould be extracted from the source data.  We will have four data sets:
#'
#' 1. All Causes United States
#' 2. All Causes by State
#' 3. By Cause United States
#' 4. By Cause by State
